							Hey everyone! I'm Jake and I am a rising junior studying Computer

							as a software development intern this Summer. Unfortunately that
							was rescinded due to COVID-19, so I am looking to put my skills to
							good work. I have experience with web development and this year I
							was one of fifteen people selected to take a course offered at
							Google's Cambridge offices in Android development

							Hi everyone, I am Aaron, and I am going to be a senior in the fall
							at Rutgers University New Brunswick majoring in Computer Science.
							Back in November 2019 I was accepted into an internship for the
							summer but due to COVID-19, it was rescinded. I am most
							experienced in Java, but I know a fair amount of C#, Python, and
							C++, having worked in C# with Unity in class, and having made
							simple games in C++ and Python too. I hope that through this
							progam I can help create something meaningful over the summer and
							build up my programming ability

							Hi guys, my name is Gabriel and I’m a rising junior studying
							Information Science on a cybersecurity track and minoring in
							cybersecurity. I’ve worked with HTML/CSS/JavaScript but it was
							rudimentary. I just finished my second semester working with
							Python and I love it. I am also starting to familiarize myself
							with Linux, Kalilinux and violent python. I am mostly here because
							my internship got cancelled and I want to keep learning but it’s
							harder to learn alone so this is a perfect environment.

							Hey everyone, my name is Ashim Sedhain. I am an international
							student at the University of Texas. I am a rising junior
							interesting in web development and machine learning. I had a
							software engineering internship for the summer in which I was
							hoping to work with a team and solve real-world problems. But
							unfortunately, it was canceled. I am hoping I will still be able
							to do that while meeting new people and learning cool new
							technologies. HYO seems like a great place to start. Talking to
							people who share the same passion as me will be a good way to stay
							motivated and accountable. And at the end of the day, I want a
							cool story of how I spent my summer and what I did when faced with
							a challenge. I am currently working on a black and white
							colorization web application that you can see
